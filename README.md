## Minimizing Jerk in Longitudinal Speed Control : PID vs. MPC
---
### Objectives
- Design and implement a PID controller for longitudinal speed regulation.
- Design and implement an MPC controller with jerk-related penalties or input-rate constraints.
- Simulate acceleration and deceleration scenarios (step input, S-curve, variable target speeds).
- Evaluate and compare controller performance using key metrics: jerk (RMS, peak), settling time,and energy consumption.
- Provide insights into trade-offs between controller simplicity (PID) and performance/constraint handling (MPC).
