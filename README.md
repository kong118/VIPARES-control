# VIPARES-control
---
## Controls Repository for VIP ARES, Path Planning and Controls vs. Human Team
---
### Objectives

- Implement an MPC controller with jerk-related penalties or input-rate constraints.
- Use MPC controller to simulate an autonomous vehicle tracking the paths generated by the path planning teamâ€‹
- Evaluate controller performance using key metrics: jerk (RMS, peak), settling time,and energy consumption.

### Install Required Dependencies
- In a python virtual environment, do:
  ```terminal
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
